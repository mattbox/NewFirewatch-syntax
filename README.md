## Firewatch Syntax Theme

![firewatch-syntax](http://i.imgur.com/nnVNTpz.png)

A Syntax Theme forked from [SebastianSzturo](https://github.com/SebastianSzturo/firewatch-syntax) inspired by [Firewatch](http://www.firewatchgame.com/). MIT license.

Added more syntax stylizing and highlighting with some very minor tweaks to the color palette. The idea was to expand the theme without cluttering it.

Wallpaper available from the [Campo Santo blog](http://blog.camposanto.com/post/138965082204/firewatch-launch-wallpaper-when-we-redid-the).

Screenshots paired with [Nucleus-Dark-UI](https://atom.io/themes/nucleus-dark-ui)
